## üìå Overview

This project implements a robust **Visual SLAM pipeline** capable of operating in **dynamic environments**, where moving objects (e.g., people, vehicles) can interfere with traditional feature-based localization and mapping. By detecting and filtering dynamic objects, the system maintains accurate localization and map consistency. The given photo above is an architectural building in the University of Minnesota, where we performed our first milestone using the Visual SLAM algorithm where only static feautures were present.

> üß† Built during my graduate coursework at the University of Minnesota (CSCI 5561 - Computer Vision).  
> üîç Core modules include: ORB feature tracking, dynamic object detection using YOLO/Mask R-CNN, visual odometry, and bundle adjustment.
